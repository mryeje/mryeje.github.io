    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-view application centered around a primary search interface. The user can type a name into the search bar, which provides autocomplete suggestions. Selecting a name or searching displays a grid of result cards, each containing a billionaire's name, a summary of their wealth origin, and a visually distinct Meritocracy Score. This structure was chosen for its simplicity and directness, allowing users to quickly access the specific information they are interested in without navigating complex menus, directly addressing the prompt's request for a search-focused tool. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The primary "visualization" is the Meritocracy Score, presented as a colored numerical badge on each result card. Report Info: Meritocracy Score -> Goal: Inform/Compare -> Presentation Method: Styled HTML div (badge) -> Interaction: Filtering via search -> Justification: This provides an immediate, scannable visual cue about the billionaire's background, allowing for quick comparison between individuals shown in the search results. The search bar with autocomplete serves the goal of organizing and accessing the data efficiently. -->
