            <h2>Introduction: A Top-Secret Mission for a Master Builder!</h2>
            <p>Greetings, Agent L.</p>
            <p>We've been watching you. Your skills in building tricky, awesome levels in Mario Maker are legendary. But now, we have a new mission for you, should you choose to accept it.</p>
            <p>Your mission: build the ultimate 3D obstacle courseâ€”an "Obby"â€”in the secret world of Roblox Studio. You'll get access to a high-tech secret lab, learn to write secret codes, and build traps so tricky they'll make your friends cry (with laughter, probably).</p>
            <p>This message will not self-destruct, because we need you to read it. Let's get building!</p>
            <div class="riddle">
                <p><strong>Your First Riddle:</strong> What has many keys but can't open a single lock?</p>
                <p>... A piano! And soon, your computer keyboard will be the key to unlocking new game-making powers!</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="module1">
            <h2>Module 1: Your Secret Lab - Getting to Know Roblox Studio</h2>
            <h4>Objective: Get comfortable with the Roblox Studio interface and 3D movement. No coding yet!</h4>
            <div class="mission-briefing">
                <h3>Mission Briefing</h3>
                <p>First things first, Agent L. Every master builder needs a secret lab. We're going to get you set up in Roblox Studio and teach you how to move around and use your basic tools. This is like learning where all the blocks are in Mario Maker before you start building.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Lessons:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Downloading Your Lab:</strong> Your first task is to get the software. With a grown-up's help, go to the Roblox website and find the "Create" button. Follow the instructions to download and install Roblox Studio. This is your new headquarters!</li>
                <li><strong>The Three Big Screens:</strong> When you open your lab, you'll see a lot of buttons. Don't worry! We only need to know three things for now:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The 3D Viewport:</strong> The giant window in the middle. This is your building area!</li>
                        <li><strong>The Explorer:</strong> This is your <strong>Toy Box</strong>. It's a list on the right side that shows every single thing in your game.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Properties Window:</strong> This is the <strong>Control Panel</strong>. When you click on a toy from your Toy Box, this window lets you change everything about it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Flying and Walking:</strong> To move around your lab, use the <code>W</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>S</code>, and <code>D</code> keys, just like in many games. To look around, hold down the right mouse button and move your mouse. You can fly! This is how you'll get a good view of your creations.</li>
                <li><strong>Your First Building Block:</strong> Let's add something to your empty world. At the top of the screen, find the <strong>Home</strong> tab and click the button that says <strong>Part</strong>. A gray brick will appear. Congratulations, you've made your first object!</li>
                <li><strong>Project #1: The Rainbow Road:</strong> Time for your first project. Add a bunch of Parts to your world. Click on each one and look at the <strong>Properties</strong> window (your Control Panel). Find the property called <code>BrickColor</code> and click it to change the color. Find the one called <code>Material</code> to change its texture from plastic to wood, metal, or even grass! Try to make a long road with many different colors and materials.</li>
                <li><strong>The Most Important Button in the Universe:</strong> Click on one of your new parts and press the <strong>Play</strong> button at the top. Uh oh! Did your part fall out of the sky? That's because it doesn't have gravity turned off. Now, stop the game. Select your part again and find the <strong>Anchor</strong> button in the <strong>Home</strong> tab. It looks like an anchor from a ship. Click it. Now press <strong>Play</strong> again. It stays put! <strong>ALWAYS ANCHOR YOUR PLATFORMS!</strong> This is the #1 rule for all master builders.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>YouTube Reference:</h4>
            <p>To see a pro do it, watch the first few minutes of this video. It shows you how to move around and place your first parts.

            <h2>Module 2: The Art of the Obby - Building Your First Jumps</h2>
            <h4>Objective: Use the building tools to create a simple, multi-stage platforming challenge.</h4>
            <div class="mission-briefing">
                <h3>Mission Briefing</h3>
                <p>Okay, Agent L, you know your way around the lab. Now it's time to build the foundation of your obby. We're going to create a series of jumps. Remember, a good obby is like a good joke: it's all about the timing!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="joke">
                <p><strong>Today's Joke:</strong> Why did the scarecrow win an award?</p>
                <p>... Because he was outstanding in his field!</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Lessons:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Holy Trinity of Tools:</strong> At the top of the screen, next to the Anchor button, you will find your three most important tools: <strong>Move</strong>, <strong>Scale</strong>, and <strong>Rotate</strong>.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Move:</strong> Lets you move parts up, down, left, and right.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Lets you make parts bigger or smaller, longer or shorter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rotate:</strong> Lets you spin parts around.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Practice using these three tools on a Part until you feel like a pro.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Deleting the Floor:</strong> A good obby is dangerous! Let's get rid of that boring floor. In your <strong>Explorer</strong> window (the Toy Box), find the item named <code>Baseplate</code>. Click on it, and then press the <strong>Delete</strong> key on your keyboard. Poof! Now if a player falls, they fall into the endless sky!</li>
                <li><strong>The Spawn Point:</strong> The block you start on is called a <code>SpawnLocation</code>. You can use the <strong>Move</strong> tool to place it at the beginning of your obby. Make sure the little person icon on it is facing the direction you want the player to go.</li>
                <li><strong>Project #2: The Leaping Lizard Gauntlet:</strong> Time for your second project. Your mission is to build a sequence of 5 to 7 platforms that a player has to jump across. Use the <strong>Scale</strong> and <strong>Move</strong> tools to make some jumps short, some long, some high, and some low. After you place a few platforms, use the <strong>Play Here</strong> button (it's under the main Play button) to test your course. Are the jumps possible? Are they too easy? Are they too hard? A master builder always tests their work!</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Module 3: The Secret Code - Making Things Happen with Scripts</h2>
            <h4>Objective: Write your very first Lua script to make a part interactive.</h4>
            <div class="mission-briefing">
                <h3>Mission Briefing</h3>
                <p>Agent L, you've mastered building. But what if you could give your blocks... superpowers? That's where scripting comes in. It's a secret code that tells your parts what to do. Our first spell will be the "Disappearing Platform" trick!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="riddle">
                <p><strong>Today's Riddle:</strong> What has to be broken before you can use it?</p>
                <p>... An egg! And we're about to "crack" the code!</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Lessons:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>What's a Script?</strong> A script is just a list of instructions for the computer, like a recipe for a cake. The computer is very literal, so it will follow your recipe <em>exactly</em> as you write it. The language for these recipes is called <strong>Lua</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Your First Script:</strong> In the <strong>Explorer</strong>, find one of the platforms you made. Click the little <code>+</code> sign next to its name and select <strong>Script</strong>. A new window will open. It will probably say <code>print("Hello, world!")</code>. This is a tradition for coders, but we don't need it. Delete that line so you have a blank page.</li>
                <li><strong>The Recipe for a Fading Trap:</strong> We are going to write a script that makes a platform disappear for a few seconds when a player touches it. Type this recipe <em>exactly</em> as you see it. Punctuation and capitalization are very important!
<pre><code>local part = script.Parent

local function onTouch(otherPart)
    if otherPart.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid") then
        part.Transparency = 1
        part.CanCollide = false
        wait(3)
        part.Transparency = 0
        part.CanCollide = true
    end
end

part.Touched:Connect(onTouch)</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Project #3: The Ghost Bridge:</strong> Now for the fun part. Build a long bridge made of 5 or 6 separate parts. Put this same script inside <em>every single part</em> of the bridge. Now when you test it, you'll have to run across before the bridge disappears behind you!</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Module 4: Level Up! - Creating Killer Obstacles</h2>
            <h4>Objective: Learn to create classic obby obstacles like kill bricks and conveyors.</h4>
            <div class="mission-briefing">
                <h3>Mission Briefing</h3>
                <p>Every great obby needs great traps. It's time to add some real danger to your course, Agent L. We'll create "lava bricks" that reset the player and speedy conveyors that try to push them off!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="joke">
                <p><strong>Today's Joke:</strong> What do you call a cow that can't moo?</p>
                <p>... A milk dud!</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Lessons:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Insta-Reset Brick (Kill Brick):</strong> This is one of the most popular traps. Make a new Part, color it red like lava, and Anchor it. Now, add a new script to it with this recipe:
<pre><code>local killBrick = script.Parent

local function onTouch(otherPart)
    local partParent = otherPart.Parent
    local humanoid = partParent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")

    if humanoid then
        humanoid.Health = 0
    end
end

killBrick.Touched:Connect(onTouch)</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li><strong>The Pushy Platform (Conveyor):</strong> This one is even easier and doesn't need a script to start! Add a new Part and make it long like a treadmill. In the <strong>Properties</strong> window, find the property called <code>Velocity</code>. This is the speed and direction the part is moving. Try typing <code>10</code> into the first number (the X value). Now when you play, the part will push you! You can change the numbers to make it push players faster, slower, or in different directions. You can even make them go up!</li>
                <li><strong>Project #4: The Gauntlet of Doom:</strong> Your mission is to combine everything you have learned. Create a new section of your obby that has:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A few normal jumps.</li>
                        <li>A disappearing "Ghost Bridge."</li>
                        <li>A floor of red "Kill Bricks" you have to jump over.</li>
                        <li>A final conveyor belt that tries to push you off the finish line.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This will be your most challenging and awesome section yet!
                </li>
            </ol>
